      <h5><b>Essential idea</b></h5>
      <p>Materials are selected for manufacturing products based primarily on their properties.</p>
        
      
    <p><a href="" >4.1 Properties of materials</a></p>
    <p>The rapid pace of scientific discovery and new technologies has had a major impact on material science, 
        giving designers many more materials from which to choose for their products. 
        These new materials have given scope for “smart” new products or enhanced classic designs. 
        Choosing the right material is a complex and difficult task with physical, aesthetic, mechanical and appropriate properties 
        to consider. Environmental, moral and ethical issues surrounding choice of materials for use in any product, 
        service or system also need to be considered. (2.1)
    </p>
    <p><a href="">4.2a Metals and metallic alloys</a></p>
    <p>Typically hard and shiny with good electrical and thermal conductivity, metals are a very useful resource for the manufacturing industry. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use and so understanding how to manipulate these materials is vital to the success of any application. (2.2)</p>


        <p><a href="">4.2b Timber</a></p>
    <p>Timber is a major building material that is renewable and uses the Sun’s energy to renew itself in a continuous cycle. While timber manufacture uses less energy and results in less air and water pollution than steel or concrete, consideration needs to be given to deforestation and the potential negative environmental impact the use of timber can have on communities and wildlife. (3.6)</p>
    
    <p><a href="">4.2c Glass</a></p>
    <p>The rapid pace of technological discoveries is
        very evident in the manufacture and use of glass
        in electronic devices. Different properties have
        been presented in glass for aesthetic or safety considerations for many years but the future of glass seems to be interactivity alongside electronic systems. • The structure of glass is not well understood, but
        as more is learned, its use is becoming increasingly prominent in building materials and structural applications. (2.2)</p>

        <p><a href="">4.2d Plastic</a></p>
    <p>Most plastics are produced from petrochemicals. 
        Motivated by the finiteness of oil reserves and threat of global warming, bio-plastics are being developed. 
        These plastics degrade upon exposure to sunlight, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes, wind erosion and in some cases pest or
         insect attack, but in most cases this does not lead to full breakdown of the plastic. When selecting materials, designers must 
         consider the moral, ethical and environmental implications of their decisions. (3.6) </p>
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-6 bg-warning text-dark">
        
         <p><a href="">4.2e Textiles</a></p>
         <p>The continuing evolution of the textiles industry provides a wide spread of applications from high- performance technical textiles to the more traditional clothing market. More recent developments in this industry require designers to combine traditional textile science and new technologies leading to exciting applications in smart textiles, sportswear, aerospace and other potential areas. (2.2) 
            </p>

         <p><a href="">4.2f Composites</a></p>
         <p>Composites are an important material in an intensely competitive global market. New materials and technologies are being produced frequently for
            the design and rapid manufacture of high-quality composite products. Composites are replacing more traditional materials as they can be created with properties specifically designed for the intended application. Carbon fibre has played an important part in weight reduction for vehicles and aircraft. (2.2)</p>
                       
            <p><a href="">4.3 Scales of production</a></p>
            <p>Decisions on scale of production are influenced by the volume or quantities required, types of materials used to make the products and the type of product being manufactured. There are also considerations of staffing, resources and finance. (1.15)</p>
            
            <p><a href="">4.4 Manufacturing processes </a></p>
            <p>Designers sometimes engineer products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. Design for manufacture (DfM) exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but differs greatly depending on the manufacturing technologies used. This practice not only focuses on the design of a product’s components, but also on quality control and assurance. (1.11)</p>
            
            <p><a href="">4.5 Production systems </a></p>
            <p>As a business grows in size and produces more  units of output, then it will aim to experience falling  average costs of production—economies of scale.  The business is becoming more efficient in its use of inputs to produce a given level of output. Designers should incorporate internal and external economies of scale when considering different production methods  and systems for manufacture. (1.11) 
            </p>
            <p><a href="">4.6 Robots in automated production </a></p>
            <p>Designers should consider the benefits of increased efficiency and consistency when using robots in production and be able to explore the latest advances in technology to ensure the optimum manufacturing process is used. However, a good designer will also understand their responsibility to consider the moral and ethical issues surrounding increased use of automation, and the historical impact of lost jobs. (2.5
