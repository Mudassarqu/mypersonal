      <h5><b>Essential idea</b></h5>
      <p>The protection of a novel idea of how to solve a problem is a major factor in commercial design.</p>
    
        
      
    <p><a href="" >5.1 Invention</a></p>
    <p>Invention by lone inventors or in collaborative, creative teams is at the forefront of design. Designers must not only be creative and innovative, but also understand the concepts that will make a new product viable. A designer must use imagination
        and be firmly grounded in factual and procedural knowledge while remembering the needs and limitations of the end user. (2.3, 2.4)
    </p>
    <p><a href="">5.2 Innovation</a></p>
    <p>Designers will be successful in the marketplace when they solve long-standing problems, improve on existing solutions or find a “product gap”. The constant evaluation and redevelopment of products is key, with unbiased analysis of consumers and commercial opportunities. (1.1)</p>


        <p><a href="">5.3 Strategies for innovation</a></p>
    <p>Companies encourage advancements in technology and services, usually by investing in research and development (R&D) activities. Even though the R&D may be carried out by a range of different experts from varied fields of research, the development process is often based on common principles and strategies to identify the direction of development. This methodology structures the R&D of new technologies and services. (1.7)</p>
    
    <p><a href="">5.4 Stakeholders in invention and innovation</a></p>
    <p>Collaborative generation of knowledge and high efficiency information flow allow for diversity, increased resilience, reliability and stability within an organization. Through participatory research, stakeholders can make full use of the resulting innovation and invention, by transferring findings relevant to the sector in which they are positioned. A designer’s increased awareness through shared industry knowledge enhances profitability and policy. (1.17) 


    </p>

        <p><a href="">5.5 Product life cycle</a></p>
    <p>Designers need to consider the whole product
        cycle of potential products, services and systems throughout the design cycle and beyond. Products may have an impact not only on the direct consumer but also on society at large and the environment. (1.16) </p>
    
    
        <p><a href="">5.6 Roger's characteristics of innovation and consumers</a></p>
        <p>Rogers’ four main elements that influence the spread  of new ideas (innovation, communication channels,  
            time and a social system) rely heavily on human capital. The ideas must be widely accepted in order to be self-  sustainable.
             Designers must consider various cultures • and communities to predict how, why and at what rate new ideas and technology
              will be adopted. (1.7)</p>

              <p><a href="">5.7 Innovation, design and marketing specifications</a></p>
              <p>Designers must establish clear parameters for a marketing specification in order to create unique and creative solutions to a problem. Designers need  to collect valid and useful data from the target market and 
                  audience throughout the design cycle  to ensure the specification includes certain essential components. (1.9, 1.10) </p>

         <p><a href="">4.2e Textiles</a></p>
         <p>The continuing evolution of the textiles industry provides a wide spread of applications from high- performance technical textiles to the more traditional clothing market. More recent developments in this industry require designers to combine traditional textile science and new technologies leading to exciting applications in smart textiles, sportswear, aerospace and other potential areas. (2.2) 
            </p>

         <p><a href="">4.2f Composites</a></p>
         <p>Composites are an important material in an intensely competitive global market. New materials and technologies are being produced frequently for
            the design and rapid manufacture of high-quality composite products. Composites are replacing more traditional materials as they can be created with properties specifically designed for the intended application. Carbon fibre has played an important part in weight reduction for vehicles and aircraft. (2.2)</p>
                       
            <p><a href="">4.3 Scales of production</a></p>
            <p>Decisions on scale of production are influenced by the volume or quantities required, types of materials used to make the products and the type of product being manufactured. There are also considerations of staffing, resources and finance. (1.15)</p>
            
            <p><a href="">4.4 Manufacturing processes </a></p>
            <p>Designers sometimes engineer products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. Design for manufacture (DfM) exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but differs greatly depending on the manufacturing technologies used. This practice not only focuses on the design of a product’s components, but also on quality control and assurance. (1.11)</p>
            
            <p><a href="">4.5 Production systems </a></p>
            <p>As a business grows in size and produces more  units of output, then it will aim to experience falling  average costs of production—economies of scale.  The business is becoming more efficient in its use of inputs to produce a given level of output. Designers should incorporate internal and external economies of scale when considering different production methods  and systems for manufacture. (1.11) 
            </p>
            <p><a href="">4.6 Robots in automated production </a></p>
            <p>Designers should consider the benefits of increased efficiency and consistency when using robots in production and be able to explore the latest advances in technology to ensure the optimum manufacturing process is used. However, a good designer will also understand their responsibility to consider the moral and ethical issues surrounding increased use of automation, and the historical impact of lost jobs. (2.5)
