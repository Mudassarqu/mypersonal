<p class="blue">Scales of measurement</p>
<p>The collecting of psychological data involves the study of human behavior and responses. Designers will use a variety of methods to gather psychological data.</p>    
<p>Understanding each method, the type of scale it uses, and whether the data gathered is qualitative or quantitative can help designers interpret the significance of the data and how it can be applied to the design context.</p>

<p class="blue">Nominal Scale</p>
<p>Nominal scales are used for labelling a variable. Common examples are checkboxes for characteristics such as gender, city, favorite food, etc.. The items in the list have no real numerical value or relationship to one another.</p>
<img src="1.1B-Image1.png">

<p class="blue">Ordinal Scale</p>
<p>Ordinal scales list items in order of importance or significance. These types of scales usually measure a feeling or perception along a continuum (unhappy to happy; unsatisfied to satisfied). However there is no numerical difference between on value and the next. For example</p>
<p class="blue">Interval Scale</p>
<p>Interval scales represent the order of values as well as showing the difference. A Celsius thermometer displays the difference between each unit as the same. i.e. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that Interval scales do not have an absolute zero. In the case of the Celsius thermometer the zero is arbitrarily set to the freezing point of water.</p>

<p class="blue">Ratio Scale</p>
<p>Ratio scales are the most comprehensive scales, and in some way are the perfect combination of other Scales: They show the exact difference between units (Interval scales); They show the order of units (Ordinal scales); and they have absolute zero.</p>
<p>Taken together, Ratio  scales  provide the most comprehensive form of quantitative data for analysis and research.</p>

<p class="blue">Collecting Psychological Data</p>
<p>Researchers, and designers, can use a wide variety of methods for collecting data about users, their behavior, and perceptions. Designers should  consider what types of research strategies to use in order to gather meaningful, and accurate data.</p>
<p>Interviews involve asking people questions to learn more about their beliefs, experiences, needs, etc.</p>
<p>Surveys consist of a set of questions that are asked to each participant. </p>
<p>Observation involves watching the subject as they engage in a task, work in a space, or try to complete some activity. Observations can take place in the laboratory, place or work, or in a natural environment,.</p>
<p>Standardized tests are designed to measure a user's performance or ability and for the results to be compared to that of other users in the group.</p>
<img src="1.1B-Image4.png"> 
<BR>
<p class="blue">Human Information Processing System (HIPS)</p>
<p>Humans are information processing systems, just as computers are. As designers, we must consider how the human mind processes and acts upon information. </p>
<img src="1.1B-Image6.png">
<p>Just as important as understanding how the mind processes information, it understanding how this system can break down. If there is too much stimulus (Input), or if there is no way to process the information, an error, mistake or accident can occur.</p>
<p>Take for example a driver of a car trying to answer a phone. The human brain can only process so much stimulus at a given time: reaching for the ringing phone, driving the car, paying attention to traffic signals, and noticing oncoming cars all place demands on the brain. There is simply too much information to processes quickly and accurately. The brain cannot cope, and something will get missed (not noticing a deer crossing the road?) and an accident will happen.</p>
<p class="blue">Many factors can affect how well we process information</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age: the user may be too young and not have learnt the skills to accomplish the task; the use may be too old and have forgotten how to do the task. e.g. The fine-motor skills of young children may have not developed enough for them to turn a dial precisely</li>
    <li>Strength: the user may be too weak to do the task. e.g. They may not be strong enough to press a switch or pull a lever.</li>
    <li>Skills: the user may not have learnt the skills yet, or the skills may be to complex to learn without a lot of practice. e.g. Riding a bicycle on a flat surface requires practice before it can be done well. Riding a mountain bike downhill at speed requires even more practice.</li>
    <li>Health: the user may not be physically or mentally healthy enough to carry out the task. e.g. They may be injured or have a condition which prevents them from doing the task easily.</li>

</ul>
<img src="1.1B-Image5.png">
<BR>
<p class="blue">Environmental Factors</p>
<p>Users respond to environmental factors and these can affect how they perform. Environmental factors include sound, temperature, lighting, air quality, and smell. Environmental factors can have effects on Comfort, Alertness, and Perception</p>
<p>Designers should understand that environmental factors can affect people in different ways. A room temperature that is comfortable to one person might be too hot or too cold for another. Likewise, a person who is mobile in a given space is going to be warmer than a person who sits at a desk (Think of teachers and students). Studies also show that women typically feel colder than men do, and thus prefer a warmer temperature.</p>
<p class="blue">Alertness</p>
<p>Alertness refers to the ability to be focused and awake. Environmental factors will affect our level of alertness in different ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature: Too hot and we get sleepy and less alert; Too cold and we become very alert</li>
    <li>Sound: Too loud and it can be distracting or even damaging to our hearing. Repetitive or high-pitched sounds can be annoying, distracting, or irritating.</li>
    <li>Lighting: Too dark or too light can cause strain on the eyes, causing headaches. Types of indoor lighting can also affect people. Florescent lighting is cooler and can cause eyestrain and headaches, for example</li>
    <li>Air quality: Dusty or stuffy air can make it difficult to breathe.</li>
